We build a free and open source website, with HTML Language and CSS for web<br> design using Notepad++.<br><br>
Notepad++ is a free source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports<br> several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed<br> by GNU General Public License.<br><br>
For that reason Notepad++ is Free and Open Source software.<br>
We proudly present you our very first approach towards building a website using<br> HTML with simplistic design coded in the CSS to create a minimalistic feel into<br>our first project called "OurSite".</p>

Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code<br>
editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.<br><br>Running in
the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" style="color: black"><b>GNU General Public License.</b></a>
<br>
Based on the powerful editing component <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/" style="color: black"><b>Scintilla</b></a>, Notepad++ is written in C++<br>
and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and <br>
smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing<br> 
user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide<br>
emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce<br> 
power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
